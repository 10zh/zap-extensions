<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h1>Mga patakaran ng passive scan-alpha</h1>
Ang mga sumosonod na alituntonin ay kalidad ng alpha passive scan ay kasama sa add-on na ito:

<h2>Asp. net viewstate pagbubunyag</h2>
Ang isang ASP.NET ViewState ay isiwalat ng application / web server

<h2>ASP.NET ViewState integridad</h2>
Ang application ay hindi gumagamit ng Code Authentication Code (MAC) upang maprotektahan ang integridad ng ASP.NET ViewState, na maaaring tampered ng isang malisyosong client

<h2>Pagsisiwalat ng Base64</h2>
Ang naka-encode na data Base64 ay isiwalat ng application / web server

<h2>Nawawal ang nilalaman sa seguridad ng patakarang header</h2>
Ito ay pagsusuri ng HTML sa tugon ng mga header para sa presensiya ng nilalaman ayon sa siguridad at patakaran ng header.<br>
Sapamamagitan ng default ay sinosuri ang alituntunin ng "nilalaman-siguridad-patakaran ng header, at sa Mababang threshold ay nag susuri din para sa" x-nilalaman-patakaran-siguridad " at "X-WebKit-CSP" ng mga hrader.
<p>
Kung ang "nilalaman-seguridad-patakaran-report-lamang" ang header ay nakakita ng tugon sa INFO Para itaas ang alerto. Maaring ito ay kumakatawan sa pag sisikap ng nag papatupad sa aktibong pagiging pino o binobuo o ang Isa na kung saan lamang ng bahagya ang ipinatutupad.

<h2>nakaka lason na cookie</h2>
Tinitignan ng pag susuring ito ang idudulot sa gumagamit ng mga input sa query pisi parametro at ang post sa mga data upang tukuyin kung saan maaaring kuntrolin ang mga parametro ng cookie. Ito ay tinatawag na pag atake ng nakakalason cookie, at ito'y mapagsasamantalahan kung ang umatake ay mamanipulahe ang cookie sa iba't ibang paraan. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.

<h2>Cookie Without SameSite Attribute</h2>
This reports any cookies that do not have the SameSite attribute or that do not have a recognised valid value for that attribute.

<h2>Cross Domain Misconfiguration</h2>
Passively scan responses for Cross Domain MisConfigurations, which relax the Same Origin Policy in the web browser, for instance.<br>
The current implementation looks at excessively permissive CORS headers.

<h2>Directory Browsing</h2>
Passively scan responses for signatures that are indicative that Directory Browsing is possible.

<h2>Example File Passive Scanner</h2>
This implements an example passive scan rule that loads strings from a file that the user can edit.<br>

<h2>Example Simple Passive Scanner</h2>
This implements a very simple example passive scan rule.<br>
For more details see: http://zaproxy.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/hacking-zap-3-passive-scan-rules.html

<h2>Hash Disclosure</h2>
Passively scan for password hashes disclosed by the web server. <br>
Various formats are including, including some formats such as MD4, MD5, and SHA*, which are sometimes used for purposes other than to contain password hashes. 

<h2>HeartBleed</h2>
Passively scans for HTTP header responses that may indicate that the server is vulnerable to the critical HeartBleed OpenSSL vulnerability. 

<h2>HTTP to HTTPS Insecure Transition in Form Post</h2>
This check looks for insecure HTTP pages that host HTTPS forms. The issue is that an insecure HTTP page can easily be hijacked through MITM and the secure HTTPS form can be replaced or spoofed.

<h2>HTTPS to HTTP Insecure Transition in Form Post</h2>
This check identifies secure HTTPS pages that host insecure HTTP forms. The issue is that a secure page is transitioning to an insecure page when data is uploaded through a form. The user may think they're submitting data to a secure page when in fact they are not.

<h2>Insecure Component</h2>
Passively scans the server response headers and body generator content for product versions, which are then cross-referenced against a list of product versions known to be vulnerable to various CVEs. 
A list of ranked CVEs and CVSS severity scores is output for each product noted to be vulnerable. 
Currently, the following server side products are supported:<br>

<h2>Image Location Scanner</h2>
<p>Passively scans for GPS location exposure in images during normal security
assessments of websites.  Image Location Scanner assists in situations where
end users may post profile images and possibly give away their home location,
e.g. a dating site or children's chatroom.  A whitepaper on this can be found
at http://veggiespam.com/ils/</p>

<p>Note: In order for this plug-in to operate, ZAP must be configured to
receive and process images.  To do this, go to the ZAP Options panel (Tools
&rarr; Options), choose Display, and enable the checkbox for "Process images in
HTTP requests/responses".  In addition, ZAP images cannot be filtered out via
the settings "Global Exclude URL" or the Session Properties for "Exclude from
Proxy". </p>

<h2>Open Redirect</h2>
Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks

<h2>HTTP Server Response Header Scanner</h2>
This checks response headers for the presence of a server header that contains version details.
At LOW Threshold will raise an alert based on presence of the header field whether or not a version string is detected.

<h2>Source Code Disclosure</h2>
Application Source Code was disclosed by the web server

<h2>Strict Transport Security Header Scanner</h2>
This scanner checks HTTPS responses for the presence of a HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header and tests for various implementation concerns, 
alerting if they're found.

Alerts generated:
<ul>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set: </b> If the response is HTTPS and the header is completely missing.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Disabled: </b> If the response is HTTPS and the max-age value is set to zero, thus resetting the browser's HSTS information for the site.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Multiple Header Entries (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS and there is more than one HSTS header on the response.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Missing Max-Age (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS, a HSTS header is specified but the max-age value does not contain a number.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Defined via META (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response body includes a META tag which attempts to define HSTS.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Header on Plain HTTP Response: </b> If the response is HTTP and the HSTS header is present.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Max-Age Malformed (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS and the HSTS header is present, but there are quotes preceding the max-age directive (quotes are allowed around the max-age value, but not around the directive itself).</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Malformed Content (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS and a HSTS header is present, but there is some unexpected content (such as curly quotes). The expectation is that the content be printable ASCII.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timestamp Disclosure</h2>
A timestamp was disclosed by the application/web server

<h2>User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS)</h2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.

<h2>User Controllable Charset</h2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks.

<h2>User Controllable Javascript Event (XSS)</h2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.            

<h2>User Controllable Javascript Property (XSS)</h2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where URL's in certain javascript properties (e.g. createElement src) might becontrolled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.            

<h2>Username Hash Found</h2>
If any context contains defined users this scanner checks all responses for the presence of hashed values representing those usernames.
Discovery of any such value may represent an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. Alerts are only raised as informational items as further manual testing is required in order to confirm and assess impact. 

<h2>X-Powered-By Header Information Leak</h2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-Powered-By details.

<h2>X-Backend-Server Header Information Leak</h2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-Backend-Server details.

<h2>Big Redirect</h2>
This check predicts the size of various redirect type responses and generates an alert if the response is greater than the predicted size. 
A large redirect response may indicate that although a redirect has taken place the page actually contained content (which may reveal sensitive information, PII, etc).

<h2>X-ChromeLogger-Data Header Information Leak</h2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-ChromeLogger-Data or X-ChromePhp-Data details.

<h2>X-Debug-Token Information Leak</h2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-Debug-Token and X-Debug-Token-Link details.
Which indicates the use/exposure of Symfony's Profiler. Symfony's Profiler provides access to a significant amount of information of interest to malicious individuals and Security Testers.

<h2>X-AspNet-Version/X-AspNetMvc-Version Header Information Leak</h2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-AspNet-Version/X-AspNetMvc-Version details.
