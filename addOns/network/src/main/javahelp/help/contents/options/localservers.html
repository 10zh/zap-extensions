	<strong>Note:</strong> This feature is only available in weekly releases and versions after 2.11.
	<br>

	<H2>Aliases</H2>
	Allows to identify the local servers/proxies with other names (domain or address). For example, to access the ZAP API with a public IP address.

	<H2>Pass-through</H2>
	Allows to configure the authorities (domain/address and port) that will pass-through ZAP, thus sending the data without being decrypted/encrypted.
	This is useful when a client has certificate pinning for certain hosts or the domain/data is irrelevant to the target being tested.
	<p>Requires that the client sends a CONNECT request with the required authority. The <code>authority</code> is interpreted as a regular expression and
	needs to be present in the requested authority.
	<br>For example, to pass-through all connections to <code>example.org</code> it can be specified just <code>example.org</code>, therefore matching any port.
	<p>Using pass-through is more efficient than using excludes (e.g. Exclude from Proxy, Global Exclude URL) when all the traffic for the host is not relevant
	to the tests.
