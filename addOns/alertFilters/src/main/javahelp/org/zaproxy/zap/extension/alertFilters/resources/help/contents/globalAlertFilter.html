<p>
This screen allows you to configure Global Alert Filters which allow you to 
automatically override the risk levels of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules.
Unlike <a href="alertFilter.html">Context Alert Filters</a> they apply to all alerts raised, 
not just those raised in a specific context.
</p>
<p>
It shows a list of all of the Global Alert Filters along with buttons for 
adding, removing, and deleting them.
</p>
<p>
Note: The alert filters will only be applied to new alerts, not to any alerts that were
already present when the filter was created. 
</p>
<p>
The 'add' and 'modify' dialogs have the same fields as <a href="alertFilter.html">Context Alert Filters</a>.
