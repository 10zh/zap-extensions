<H1>Passive Scan Rules - Beta</H1>
The following beta quality passive scan rules are included in this add-on:

<H2>Cookie - Loosely Scoped</H2>
Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com.

<H2>Information Disclosure: In URL</H2>
Attempts to identify the existence of sensitive details within the visited URIs themselves 
(this may include parameters, document names, directory names, etc.).

<H2>Information Disclosure: Referrer</H2>
Identifies the existence of sensitive details within the the Referrer header field of HTTP requests
(this may include parameters, document names, directory names, etc.).

<H2>Information Disclosure: Suspicious Comments</H2>
Analyzes web content to identify comments which contain potentially sensitive details. Which may lead to 
further attack or exposure of unintended data.

<H2>Servlet Parameter Pollution</H2>
Searches response content for HTML forms which fail to specify an action element. Version 3 of the 
Java Servlet spec calls for aggregation of query string and post data elements which may result in 
unintended handling of user controlled data. This may impact other frameworks and technologies as well.
