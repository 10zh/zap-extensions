<H1>Automation Framework - Job Outcome Tests</H1>
The automation framework supports testing the job outcomes based on conditions that you can set in the YAML file.
Currently, the only type of tests available are statistical ones. More types will be added in the future.

<H2>Statistics</H2>
Statistics-based tests are supported by all add-ons that have an automation job. If there is a relevant
statistic used by an add-on, a test can be created for it.

A job can have tests for multiple statistics and multiple tests can be created for the same statistic.

Note that statistics-based tests will function correctly only if in memory statistics have been
